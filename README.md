# SeparateCharacterTextFieldSwift
Easy Solution for a SwiftUI TextFieldView that shows each letter separately.

It really bugged me that this isn't already implemented in Swift. The new TextField looks like this and can be used as if it was a "normal" TextField. Design specifications can easily be added, the whole struct is only around 60 lines.
